description: On stuckness, beginner's mind, and why readiness isn't chosen.

There's a story we tell about being lost. You wander, and then a guide appears. An angel. A stranger with the right words. The universe provides.

I think the causation runs backward.

The guide was already there. You couldn't see them yet.

Every genuine reorientation in my thinking shares this quality: sudden when it happened, gradual in retrospect. Months of friction I dismissed. Conversations that didn't land. Evidence I filed without processing.

The haunting part: I could usually have changed earlier. People were telling me. But their words dissolved before reaching whatever part of me would need to act.

I was defended against a truth I didn't know I was defending against.

Pirsig calls this *stuckness*, and he thinks it's a gift.

When your usual strategies fail (when you've tried everything and nothing works), you enter a state where seeing becomes possible. The expert handles every familiar problem. The stuck person, sitting with not-knowing, learns to handle the unfamiliar.

What he's describing is beginner's mind in different clothes. *Shoshin*: approaching something without the weight of what you already know. Not ignorance. Openness.

Expertise closes this aperture. *I know what this is.*

Stuckness reopens it. *I have to look.*

This is uncomfortable news for rationality.

I want to believe truth wins arguments. Present evidence, follow logic, update belief. But most people reason well—inside a frame they never chose. You can think flawlessly and be wrong, because you're reasoning from premises you've never questioned.

Rationality operates within your aperture. It cannot widen it.

Pirsig called the obstacle *value rigidity*: the inability to revalue what you've decided matters. The more foundational the belief, the more it resists revision. Not because you're stubborn. Because you'd fall apart without it.

You don't abandon a load-bearing wall because someone shows you a blueprint.

I could list the rigidities I've watched in others. The certainties that seemed obviously wrong.

I won't.

I've held my own versions of most of them. The ones I gripped tightest are the ones I'd now find unbearable. And pointing at someone's blindness has never helped them see.

What helped was stuckness. Running out of room. The strategies failing. Dissonance accumulating past the point of dismissal.

Then: noticing someone had been standing there the whole time.

---

The expert mind says *I know*.

The beginner mind says *show me*.

The stuck mind says *I don't know*.

That last one is the door.

Maybe the universe sends guides. But not when we ask, when we're ready. And readiness isn't chosen. It's what remains when choosing fails.

The guides were already there.

You become someone who can see them.
