- Perception is a tool, not a verdict. Awareness should free action, not replace it 
- Use stories to move the world. Never use them to explain yourself to yourself.
- Mastery is mundane. The spectacular emerges from the boring done well.
- Do the work precisely. Let the consequences arrive on their own.
- Wear identities lightly. Keep an inner space untouched by narrative.
