## New York

**Devocion** — Good pour over (red barrel) and cold brew.

**Do Not Feed Alligators** — Excellent cold brew and pour over selection. Wish they allowed laptops.

**Black Fox** — Solid cold brew.

**La Cabra** — Good pour over. Cold brew was fine but didn't stand out.

**Cafe Integral** — Got the El Porvenir (Nicaragua) — pineapple, cacao, butterscotch. Really loved it. Has seating but bring your devices charged.

**Partners Coffee** — Pour over was quite good.

**Little Collins** — Great breakfast and coffee. Good spot to eat, no real seating for working.

**Blue Bottle** — Decent pour over. Single origin cold brew is very good but pricey.

**Sote** — Solid cold brew with decent workspace.

**Irving Farm** — Very good cold brew. No pour overs, has seating.

**Coffee Project** — Pour over (Banko Gotiti Washed) was good. Didn't love the Chelsea location's cold brew.

**Solid State** — Decent pour over, good seating but no wifi.
