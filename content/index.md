# Jaisel Singh

Welcome! 

My name's Jaisel and welcome to my labspace on the web!

I am currently at Columbia University working on making robots actually do useful manipulation tasks. Most of my time these days is spent debugging reward functions, reading papers at 2am, and asking "but why does it work?" about things that already work. 

Previously, I spent time building rocket engines at Penn State. Worked on propulsion systems at SpaceX and thermal management at Astranis. Now I make robot arms push blocks around and somehow this is harder.

## What's here

This is where I write about things I'm figuring out. Sometimes it's technical (why is my PPO agent doing *that*?), sometimes it's just interesting problems I've run into.

**[[journal/index|Journal]]**: The messy stuff. Learning notes, random observations, things I tried that didn't work.

**[[research/index|Research]]**: The slightly less messy stuff. Paper notes, math I'm working through, ideas I'm testing.

**[[Rêveries/index|Rêveries]]**: The wandering stuff. Thoughts that don't fit anywhere else.

**[[Principles/index|Principles]]**: These change. If you notice contradictions, that means I learned something.
