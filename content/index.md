Build to understand. Understand to build.

Things I keep returning to:
- The obstacle to discovery is the illusion of knowledge, not ignorance
- Ask the dumb question. The territory others won't touch is where the interesting stuff lives
- Beauty is a heuristic—if it's ugly, something's probably wrong
- Slack isn't waste. It's where the ideas come from
- You don't need permission
- Stay on-policy: actions have outcomes, intentions don't

Currently: robot perception and learning at Columbia—getting machines to see, understand, and act. Before: propulsion at SpaceX, thermal systems at Astranis, engines at Penn State.

Outside the lab: long runs, unreasonable coffee standards, whatever book has nothing to do with robots.
