# Jaisel Singh

I build things to understand how they work.

Currently at Columbia, teaching robots to manipulate objects through reinforcement learning. Before this: rocket propulsion at SpaceX, thermal systems at Astranis, engine development at Penn State. The thread connecting it all is the same — I like taking systems apart, figuring out why they behave the way they do, and making them do something useful.

When I'm not in the lab, I'm usually running, hunting for good coffee, or reading something that has nothing to do with robotics.
